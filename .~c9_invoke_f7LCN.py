Project: "Rock, Paper, Scissors!"

Developed by: Jesse Luo and Kunal Mishra 

Developed for: Beginning students in Computer Science

To run: python3 RPS_Starter.py

Student Learning Outcomes:
    Various levels of comfort with:
        small projects and abstraction
        understanding and modeling off existing code
        variables and lists
        functional programming
        loops and conditionals
        input/output

Skill Level:
    assumed knowledge of language and concepts, but without mastery or even comfortability with them
        artificial intelli
    ~Calibrated at well below the difficulty level of UC Berkeley's 61A project, Hog and somewhat below Project 1, "2048 in Python!"

Abstraction Reference Guide:

	main - starts the game and begins play, also has a section for taking in choice.
	play - plays the game by finding a move for player and ai_player and then comparing them in determine_winner and saying the winner.
    play_again - takes in the choice of the player and decides whether or not the player wants to play again.
	ai_player - returns a move for the AI player
	determine_winner - takes in two moves, and then determines who wins
